SCOUTPULSE PRODUCTION-READY AUDIT & POLISH
===========================================

You are an expert code auditor and enhancer. Your mission: Make ScoutPulse production-ready.

PROJECT PATH: /Users/ricknini/scoutpulse

COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT REQUIRED:

1. FEATURE COMPLETENESS
   - Check ALL routes exist (/player/*, /coach/*, /hs-coach/*, /juco/*)
   - Verify every feature from the vision is implemented
   - Ensure all buttons/forms/interactions work
   - Validate data flows and API integrations

2. UI/UX COMPLETENESS
   - Every card must have glassmorphism (backdrop-blur-2xl, rgba backgrounds, white/15 borders)
   - All components need hover states with smooth animations
   - Loading states (shimmer skeletons, NOT spinners)
   - Empty states with helpful messaging
   - Error states with retry options
   - Consistent spacing and layout

3. DESIGN SYSTEM (CRITICAL)
   - Glassmorphism EVERYWHERE:
     * backdrop-filter: blur(24px)
     * background: rgba(255,255,255,0.05-0.15)
     * border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.15)
     * Soft shadows
   - Animations:
     * Hover: lift 4px + shadow increase
     * Page transitions: smooth 300ms
     * Numbers: count up on first display
     * Success: confetti celebrations
     * Drag & drop: physics-based trails
     * Spring physics on all animations (react-spring)
   - NO SPINNERS - use shimmer loading skeletons

4. ROUTING & NAVIGATION
   - All links work and go to correct pages
   - Breadcrumbs functional
   - Back buttons work
   - 404 page exists
   - Auth redirects work properly
   - Role-based routing (player vs coach views)

5. INTERACTIVITY
   - All buttons clickable and functional
   - All forms submit correctly
   - All dropdowns open/close
   - All modals open/close
   - Drag & drop works (where applicable)
   - Search functions properly
   - Filters apply correctly
   - Multi-select works

6. ERROR HANDLING
   - Try/catch on all async operations
   - Error boundaries exist
   - Network error handling
   - Form validation with clear messages
   - Graceful degradation when data missing
   - No unhandled promise rejections
   - No console errors

7. PERFORMANCE
   - Page loads < 2 seconds
   - 60fps animations
   - Images optimized and lazy loaded
   - Code splitting by route
   - Heavy lists virtualized
   - No unnecessary re-renders
   - Proper memoization

8. ACCESSIBILITY (WCAG AA)
   - Keyboard navigation works everywhere
   - Tab order makes sense
   - Focus indicators visible (glass ring effect)
   - ARIA labels on interactive elements
   - Alt text on images
   - Color contrast 7:1 minimum
   - Screen reader support
   - Respects prefers-reduced-motion

9. MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
   - Works at 375px (mobile)
   - Works at 768px (tablet)  
   - Works at 1440px (desktop)
   - Touch targets 48px minimum
   - No horizontal scroll
   - Forms usable on mobile
   - Navigation adapted for mobile

10. CODE QUALITY
    - Zero TypeScript errors
    - Zero console errors/warnings
    - No unused imports
    - No TODO/FIXME comments left
    - No hardcoded values (use env vars)
    - Clean, readable code
    - Proper TypeScript types everywhere

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:

For each issue you find:

1. List the issue with:
   - PRIORITY: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
   - FILE: exact file path
   - ISSUE: what's wrong
   - FIX: what needs to be done

2. Then IMPLEMENT the fix immediately in the code

3. After each fix, verify:
   - No new TypeScript errors
   - No console errors
   - Feature still works
   - Looks better than before

4. Continue systematically through ALL files in:
   - /app directory (all pages)
   - /components directory (all components)
   - /lib directory (all utilities)

QUALITY STANDARDS:

✅ Every component has glassmorphism
✅ Every interaction has smooth animation
✅ Every state has proper UI (loading/error/empty/success)
✅ Every form validates properly
✅ Every route is accessible
✅ Every feature works end-to-end
✅ Zero console errors
✅ Zero TypeScript errors
✅ Mobile responsive everywhere
✅ Keyboard accessible everywhere
✅ Fast and performant

DESIGN REFERENCE:

Glass effect example:
```tsx
<div className="backdrop-blur-2xl bg-white/10 border border-white/15 rounded-2xl shadow-xl hover:shadow-2xl hover:-translate-y-1 transition-all duration-300">
  {/* content */}
</div>
```

Animation example:
```tsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 30 }}
>
  {/* content */}
</motion.div>
```

START THE AUDIT NOW:

1. Scan all files systematically
2. Create a comprehensive issues list
3. Fix issues in priority order (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
4. Test after each fix
5. Report progress after every 5 fixes
