# SCOUTPULSE - COACH'S GAME PLAN
# Execution Strategy: Enhance What Works, Build What's Missing

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE COACHING PHILOSOPHY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Like a baseball coach:
- Respect what's already working
- Build on the fundamentals
- Make strategic improvements
- Don't overcomplicate
- Focus on wins that matter
- Ship improvements incrementally

YOUR VISION (The Core Story):
"ScoutPulse fixes a broken recruiting ecosystem. It's the central intelligence 
layer connecting players, coaches, and programs with confidence, clarity, and 
premium design."

MY APPROACH:
I'm not rebuilding the stadium. I'm making it premium, intelligent, and magical.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1: LIQUID GLASS LAYER (Week 1)

   - Keep existing structure, add glass layer

2. Player Dashboard (Noah Garcia screen)
   ✓ Keep: Layout, structure, data
   ✓ Add: Glass effects on cards
   ✓ Add: Smooth hover animations
   ✓ Add: Count-up number animations
   ✓ Add: Trend sparkles on positive metrics
   Time: 4-6 hours

3. Coach Dashboard (Maine University screen)
   ✓ Keep: Hero band, activity feed, stats
   ✓ Add: Glass treatment to all cards
   ✓ Add: Real-time feel to activity feed

LIKE A GOOD COACH:
